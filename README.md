# MicroCloud charm for MAAS

This charm deploys MicroCloud using Juju.

## Build the charm

* Install `charmcraft` to build the charm: `snap install charmcraft --classic`
* Build the charm: `charmcraft pack`
  * For example use `--platform ubuntu@24.04:amd64` to only build the charm for a specific base and architecture

## Deploy the charm

Run `juju deploy <charm>`.

## Control plane

LXD 6.8 and later can keep the cluster database on chosen members: those with the `control-plane` role. Once at least 3 members hold the role, LXD only gives database roles to role holders. Members without the role, including new ones, stay spares. See [Control plane mode](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/lxd/latest/explanation/clusters/#clustering-control-plane) in the LXD documentation.

Pick the units that should hold the role and run the action on each:

```sh
juju run microcloud/0 microcloud/1 microcloud/2 add-control-plane-role
juju run microcloud/3 remove-control-plane-role
```

Each action changes only its own unit's LXD member, and running it twice changes nothing. Both report the role holders and whether the mode is active. The `status` action reports the mode too.

The role makes a member eligible for the database; it does not make it a voter. By default LXD keeps 3 voters and 2 standbys (`cluster.max_voters` and `cluster.max_standby`). Extra role holders stay spares until LXD needs to promote one.

Recommendations:

* Use at least 3 failure domains (Juju zones) with 2 role holders each. Losing a whole failure domain then leaves at least 4 role holders online, and LXD restores 3 voters.
* Don't give the role to more units than that without a reason. Every role holder is an LXD event hub, and every other member connects to each one.

The leader adds a warning to its status when the role holders drop to 1 or 2, or when a failure domain has fewer than 2 online role holders. The warning keeps the unit active.

Replacing a role holder:

1. `juju remove-unit` leaves the LXD member, and its role, in place. LXD keeps counting it. Remove it with `microcloud remove <name>` on a remaining unit.
2. Add the replacement unit. It joins without the role.
3. Run `add-control-plane-role` on the new unit.

Replace a failure domain's last member before removing it. The leader only checks failure domains that still have members.
